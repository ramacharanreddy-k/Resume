\employer{Feuji INC}{AI Engineer}{Aug 2024 -- Present}

\project{Customer Analytics AI -- PLZ Corp}{Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry, Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL, Terraform, React}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Architected a full-stack AI analytics platform} across 4 microservices (data engine, SSO gateway, conversational agent, React SPA frontend) deployed on AKS, \textbf{eliminating 48 hours/week of manual analysis} and \textbf{saving \$150K/year} in equivalent headcount.
  \item \textbf{Engineered an AI agent using LangGraph and Azure OpenAI} with 20 specialized tools and a 7-layer middleware stack, backed by dual-domain RAG over Cosmos DB vector search (DiskANN, 1536-dim embeddings) \textbf{grounding all responses in verified data to reduce hallucinations}, augmented by summarization and short-term memory for conversational coherence.
  \item \textbf{Built an 8-stage async data pipeline} that ingests structured and unstructured data, transforms through a parse-chunk-embed-index workflow, and persists to a \textbf{12-table PostgreSQL warehouse} and a \textbf{Cosmos DB vector store}.
  \item \textbf{Designed a centralized SSO gateway} using FastAPI RESTful APIs and MSAL with OAuth2 authorization code flow, Azure AD group-based access control, JWKS S2S token validation, and zero hardcoded secrets via Key Vault and Managed Identity.
  \item \textbf{Provisioned the entire Azure environment using Terraform} across 7 modules with passwordless RBAC throughout, covering compute, data, AI, identity, storage, scheduling, and communication services.
\end{itemize}

\project{Ask the Prospect (ATP) -- TriNet}{Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, AWS Bedrock, OpenSearch, Aurora, Langfuse, Airflow, EKS}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Built a multi-mode LangGraph agent} powering 4 capabilities -- RAG chatbot (dual-index: training docs + Gong call transcripts) with \textbf{memory continuity using short-term and long-term memory} via LangGraph PG checkpointer and store, persona-based sales role-play with AI coaching, analytics chat with text-to-OpenSearch query generation, and automated Jeopardy question generation.
  \item \textbf{Engineered a sales analytics pipeline} where LLM enriches each Gong call transcript with derived columns (win/loss, objections, competition mentions), then serves aggregate queries by generating OpenSearch queries from natural language via text-to-schema mapping.
  \item \textbf{Integrated Langfuse for full observability and bias detection} across all agent interactions, using \textbf{LLM-as-judge evaluations} for output quality scoring alongside trace-level debugging, latency monitoring, and cost tracking across every LLM call and tool execution in production.
  \item \textbf{Served as solution architect and client-facing lead}, owning the end-to-end technical vision across 4 microservices and 2 Airflow-orchestrated data pipelines deployed on EKS.
\end{itemize}

\project{ReQon -- Automated Testing Tool}{Python, LangChain, LangGraph, Google Gemini, Playwright MCP, Aurora PostgreSQL, Docker, pytest}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Engineered a LangGraph agent with Playwright MCP} that replays a user-recorded browser flow, autonomously navigates every page multiple times, and extracts locators, identifiers, functional elements, and behavioral data -- storing the full application map in S3 and Aurora PostgreSQL.
  \item \textbf{Automated the entire QA authoring workflow} -- from captured browser behavior the agent generates structured test cases in Aurora PG, executes them via Playwright MCP, and outputs verified pass/fail results, eliminating manual test case writing.
  \item \textbf{Built a code generation engine} using Jinja templates that converts captured page metadata into \textbf{pytest-compatible regression scripts} with \textbf{Page Object Model classes} for every page discovered, producing a ready-to-run test suite from a single recording.
  \item \textbf{Designed and dockerized 3 microservices} -- Recorder (Playwright codegen capture), MCP Service (AI agent, knowledge extraction, test and script generation), and Execution Service (isolated regression runner) -- saving \textbf{100+ team-hours weekly} and cutting QA costs by an estimated \textbf{\$230K/year}.
\end{itemize}

\project{AI-Powered IVR Automation -- Cotiviti}{Java, Python, LangGraph, AWS Bedrock, Transcribe, DynamoDB, Lambda, SQS, KMS, Twilio}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Designed an AI pathfinding workflow using LangGraph and AWS Bedrock} that autonomously navigates Medicare's IVR system daily -- recording calls via Twilio, transcribing with \textbf{AWS Transcribe}, and mapping the correct DTMF navigation path to \textbf{DynamoDB} as the source of truth for \textbf{200,000+ daily production calls}.
  \item \textbf{Built a mock Medicare IVR simulator} in Java as a regression testing harness, validating AI agent accuracy against simulated IVR decision trees before production deployment.
  \item \textbf{Configured the AWS CI/CD pipeline} (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy) with \textbf{KMS-encrypted PII handling} across all environments.
  \item Part of a \textbf{cross-functional team} that saved \textbf{730+ engineer-hours annually} and cut infrastructure costs by \textbf{\~{}60\%} through serverless auto-scaling, with an operations dashboard for regulatory oversight.
\end{itemize}

\employer{University at Buffalo}{AI Research Assistant}{Jan 2024 -- May 2024}

\project{Energy-Efficient LLM Inference and Carbon-Aware Optimization}{Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, NumPy, Pandas}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Conducted applied research on \textbf{LLM fine-tuning, model evaluation, and performance tuning} by benchmarking \textbf{parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)} techniques -- including \textbf{LoRA}, \textbf{knowledge distillation}, and \textbf{post-training quantization (4-bit/8-bit)} -- on GPT-2 across multiple task configurations, measuring GPU energy consumption and carbon emissions.
  \item Achieved a \textbf{19.8\% reduction in CO2 emissions} with only a \textbf{6\% increase in perplexity} using 8-bit quantization, demonstrating that significant energy savings are attainable with minimal degradation in language modeling quality.
  \item Demonstrated a \textbf{45.2\% emissions reduction} by combining distillation with quantization, quantifying the accuracy-efficiency trade-off curve to identify viable deployment configurations for resource-constrained and carbon-aware inference environments.

\employer{Flable AI}{Machine Learning Engineer}{Mar 2023 -- Aug 2023}

\project{Flable Digital Assistant}{Python, LangChain, OpenAI, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Docker, Jenkins, GitLab}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Built a \textbf{LangChain-based conversational AI} integrated with \textbf{OpenAI} that classifies user intent using \textbf{NLP techniques (transformer-based embeddings)}, maps queries to structured data categories in \textbf{PostgreSQL}, and generates natural-language responses grounded in real database results.
  \item Developed an \textbf{on-the-fly data visualization engine} that dynamically queries PostgreSQL, renders chart images from the returned data, and delivers them inline through the \textbf{Telegram bot interface} -- giving non-technical users instant access to business analytics without dashboards or manual reporting.
  \item Deployed the full stack (\textbf{FastAPI} backend + Telegram bot frontend) using \textbf{Docker} containers with \textbf{GitLab CI/CD} and \textbf{Jenkins} pipelines, reducing client's weekly analysis time by \textbf{60\%}.
